#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering entails the designing, building, testing, deploying and managing of software systems. Its main focus is building reliable, scalable and effecient softeares that meets the users needs 

It helps in building of new products or solutions. 
It ensures that products built are highly quality and easily maintained 
There is fast space of development and growth experienced in that sector 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The early computers were programmed manually using assembly languages like the C Language. (1950-1960) 
The 1970's saw the introdcution of modular programming language 
In the 90's came about the Agile development and AI integration 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis – Gather and analyze project requirements.
Planning – Define project scope, timeline, and resources.
Design – Create software architecture and user interface design.
Implementation (Coding) – Write and develop the software.
Testing – Verify software functionality and fix bugs.
Deployment – Release the software for users.
Maintenance – Provide updates and fixes as needed.

Agile methodology introduced, focusing on flexibility and collaboration.
AI and machine learning integration in software engineering for automation.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Feature	                        Waterfall	                    Agile
Approach	                      Sequential	                  Iterative
Flexibility	           Rigid, changes are difficult	          Flexible, allows continuous feedback
Customer Involvement	 Minimal until the final product	      Continuous involvement
Example         Use Cases	Large-scale, well-defined projects   Startups, dynamic projects (e.g., web applications)
                              (e.g., government systems)	




Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer

Writes and maintains code.
Implements new features and fixes bugs.
Collaborates with designers and testers.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer

Tests software for bugs and performance issues.
Develops automated and manual testing strategies.
Ensures software meets quality standards.
Project Manager

Plans and oversees software projects.
Manages timelines, resources, and team coordination.
Ensures project goals align with business needs.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Provide tools for writing, debugging, and testing code.
Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm.
Version Control Systems (VCS)

Track code changes, enable collaboration, and prevent data loss.
Examples: Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing Complexity – Use modular design and clear documentation.
Meeting Deadlines – Follow Agile practices and prioritize tasks.
Bug Fixing & Debugging – Implement rigorous testing and code reviews.
Security Risks – Follow best security practices and conduct regular audits




Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and aceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is used to test a particular feature, component and function 
Integration Testing – Ensures different modules work together.
System Testing – Tests the complete application in a real-world environment.
Acceptance Testing – Verifies software meets user requirements before release.




#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is act of issuing out commands to machines for execution 
Vague Prompt: Tell me about cars.
Improved Prompt: Explain the history and evolution of electric vehicles, including key innovations and challenges faced by manufacturers.
Why is the improved prompt better?

It specifies the focus (electric vehicles).
It includes details on history, evolution, innovations, and challenges.
It results in a more informative and relevant response.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Tell me about cars.
Improved Prompt: Explain the history and evolution of electric vehicles, including key innovations and challenges faced by manufacturers.
Why is the improved prompt better?

It specifies the focus (electric vehicles).
It includes details on history, evolution, innovations, and challenges.
It results in a more informative and relevant response.
